      "A haunting deflection and un-'fortunate' four runs - How New Zealand were denied glory at Lord's",
    popup:
      "A throw from deep caught an edge of Stokes' bat and the ball raced away for a four. It's hard to imagine a batsman scoring runs with the bat while sliding down to save himself from getting run-out. But that's what happened in the epic finale. Stunned by what just happened, New Zealand players saw their worst nightmare come true as England got six runs (two by running and four extra). Despite just three runs needed off the final two balls, the Kiwis were as spirited as ever and thanks to their nerves, England could only manage to get two of the remaining two balls to end the contest in a tie."
